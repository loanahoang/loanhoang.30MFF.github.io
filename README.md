# Assignment 1: 30MFF Website

## Concept: 

This is my first ever attempt to make a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The goal of the website is to introduce the video that my group had filmed.  

Our video has a funny, simple, and improvising style so I aimed to make a website that also have those characteristic. I want my website's visiters to have an entertaining experience with both the website and the video. Included with the funny music in the video, I chose bright and funky color for the inteface. For the font, I chose the clean and simple one. Moreover, I took advantages of boomerang clips in my website. Boomerang clips are also represent for funkiness as it usually marketed via Instagram. 

## Difficulties: 

In the process of making the website, of course I encountered various difficulties. Up till now, there are still enhancing ideas that I have not finished yet. However, I am very satisfied with my result as I could not believe that I managed to created a website. This first assignment is a good start off for me to familiarized with designing on a digital screen size canvas. I believe that so far with this experience, I be able to do even better in the upcoming projects.

# Assignment 2 : Comix Strip
## Concept: 
In this assignment, our team (Ishmal, Loan, Matthew, and Michael) is telling a story through our interactive comic website. 

We have our comic named as "Last Moments" narrating events in one day before our main protagonist dies in a car accident. We want to express the unexpectedness of deaths through our story. 

## Responsiblity:
My responsibility for this project is leanning more on the artistic and building story side than on the technical web development. 

I am responsible for the sript writing, framing the panels, color/images choosing, and media managing. More specifically, I am also in charged of finding the stock images, ambience sounds, and making the intro video. I also think that I am the person who help bonding the members and keep things on track. 

## Difficulties: 
In this project, the main difficulty that I encounter is conflicting in ideas due to different perspective about arts. We had disagreement on the font choosing, the size/ length of the video, the plot of the story, et cetera. Fortunately, we managed to compromise things to reach a futher goals of finishing our project. 

The other difficulty that our group struggle with is the poor respect of deadline. Yet, at the end, I am happy that my team succeeded in reaching our goals. 

## Improvements:
As a team member, I am satisfied with my team's result. I am glad that despite all the challenges that we encounter, we managed to have an interesting comic for the class. 

However, if I have more room for improvements, I would make the color palette more consistent between the book and the page. I would also figure out how to have the video have sound although it can be autoplayed and looped.
