#### Loan Hoang COMMUNICATIONS LABS - Fall 2020
#### Assignment 1: 30MFF Website

# Concept: 

This is my first ever attempt to make a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The goal of the website is to introduce the video that my group had filmed.  

Our video has a funny, simple, and improvising style so I aimed to make a website that also have those characteristic. I want my website's visiters to have an entertaining experience with both the website and the video. Included with the funny music in the video, I chose bright and funky color for the inteface. For the font, I chose the clean and simple one. Moreover, I took advantages of boomerang clips in my website. Boomerang clips are also represent for funkiness as it usually marketed via Instagram. 

# Difficulties: 

In the process of making the website, of course I encountered various difficulties. Up till now, there are still enhancing ideas that I have not finished yet. However, I am very satisfied with my result as I could not believe that I managed to created a website. This first assignment is a good start off for me to familiarized with designing on a digital screen size canvas. I believe that so far with this experience, I be able to do even better in the upcoming projects.
